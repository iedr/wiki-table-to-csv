# Bookmarklet to extract tables from Wikipedia pages
This is a convenience tool/bookmarklet for users to extract simple tables from Wikipedia pages, and extract them as CSV files. The CSV files are named according to the caption of the tables, or if the caption does not exist, they will be named after the table's closest enclosing header.

To get the bookmarklet or to see technical details, go [here](https://darensin01.github.io/2021/01/20/wiki-table-bookmarklet).
